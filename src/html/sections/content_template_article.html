    <h2>The causes of a wet basement</h2>
    <p>
      Did you know you can have water issues in your basement without heavy
      rains or obvious standing water? It's easy enough to see water coming
      through a crack in your floor or basement wall, but what's the real cause
      of your basement water problem?

        </div>
        <h4>The Clay Bowl Effect</h4>
        <p>
          Excavated soil that's replaced around a completed foundation isn't as
          dense and tightly packed as the undisturbed soil farther away. As a
          result, water collects in the soil immediately surrounding the house,
          putting pressure on foundation walls and causing cracks.
        </p>

            alt="hydrostatic pressure"
          />
        </div>
        <h4>Hydrostatic Pressure:</h4>
        <p>
          The weight of the water in the soil around the foundation exerts
          pressure, forcing the water through cracks, gaps, holes, and around
          windows leading into the basement.
